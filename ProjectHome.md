The goal is to write a Python script to download the entire Mathematics Genealogy Project database and to store it in a local SQLite database or update an existing one. This provides offline-access and therefore, a faster access to the database is possible. There will also be an option to visualize the data via Graphviz.
Another task is to upgrade the Python script to support specific search queries on the local SQLite database.
